# Cats Blender Plugin.

If you are using blender 3.6 please use the latest release [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/releases). Blender 3.6 is the current recomended blender version to use!
You can find the development version for Blender 3.6 [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/tree/blender-36-dev).

### Warning for Blender 4.0 users:
Though we have updated cats to blender 4.0, please note there are still some issues with MMD Tools which may break some plugin functionilty, this is not a cats issue so please redirect those issues to MMD Tools. Blender 4.0 is not our priority and will be behind the blender 3.6 version. We HIGHLY recommend using blender 3.6 for the time being unless you REALLY need the new features in 4.0, which if your just making VRChat models or doing MMD stuff you most likely don't.

Belnder 4.0 is also buggy and does have issues as well, we won't be recommending use of blender 4.x unto the first LTS comes out later this year.

However if you must use blender 4.0 you can download it from this branch [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/tree/blender-40).
You can find the development version for Blender 4.0 [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/tree/blender-40-dev).

The non official version of Cats Blender Plugin which is maintained by Yusarina, Cats is an tool designed to shorten steps needed to import and optimize models into VRChat.
Compatible models are: MMD, XNALara, Mixamo, Source Engine, Unreal Engine, DAZ/Poser, Blender Rigify, Sims 2, Motion Builder, 3DS Max and potentially more

With Cats it takes only a few minutes to upload your model into VRChat.
All the hours long processes of fixing your models are compressed into a few functions!

## Requirements

- Blender 3.6 or above (run as administrator is recommended) (Please note some features may not work in version below 3.6).
   - Blender 3.6 is Recommended as this is the latest LTS.
   - Though I have updated CATS to Blender 4.0, I do not currently recommend using 4.0 as there multiple issues with MDD Tools and Blender 4.0 which cats uses.
- Anything older then 3.6 is not supported and no longer works.
- If you have custom Python installed which Blender might use, you need to have Numpy installed
- NOTE TO WINDOWS STORE USERS, STOP USING THE WINDOWS STORE VERSION YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES, PLEASE EITHER USE THE STEAM VERSION OR THE ONE FROM THE OFFICIAL BLENDER WEBSITE.
