# Cats Blender Plugin.

**From 22/12/2023 there are seperate versions for blender 3.6 and 4.0, see below for the links. This version of cats WILL NOT support version below blender 3.6.

If you are using blender 3.6 please use the latest release [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/releases).

If you are using blender 4.x please download this version [here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/tree/blender-4.0), please note blender 4.x version can be unstable and there will be bugs due to mmd tools not being fully updated for 4.x yet, plase note the blender 4.x version will not be released unto the 4.2 LTS is out later this year, the 4.x branch is UNDER DEVELOPMENT and is not finished and WILL have issues.

The non official version of Cats Blender Plugin which is maintained by Yusarina, Cats is an tool designed to shorten steps needed to import and optimize models into VRChat.
Compatible models are: MMD, XNALara, Mixamo, Source Engine, Unreal Engine, DAZ/Poser, Blender Rigify, Sims 2, Motion Builder, 3DS Max and potentially more

With Cats it takes only a few minutes to upload your model into VRChat.
All the hours long processes of fixing your models are compressed into a few functions!

## Features

Please [Click Here](https://github.com/Yusarina/Cats-Blender-Plugin-Unofficial-/wiki/Features) to view the features of cats.


## Requirements

- Blender 3.6 or above (run as administrator is recommended) (Please note some features may not work in version below 3.6).
   - Blender 3.6 is Recommended as this is the latest LTS.
   - Though I have updated CATS to Blender 4.0, I do not currently recommend using 4.0 as there multiple issues with MDD Tools and Blender 4.0 which cats uses.
- Anything older then 3.6 is not supported and no longer works.
- If you have custom Python installed which Blender might use, you need to have Numpy installed
- NOTE TO WINDOWS STORE USERS, STOP USING THE WINDOWS STORE VERSION YOU WILL HAVE ISSUES, PLEASE EITHER USE THE STEAM VERSION OR THE ONE FROM THE OFFICIAL BLENDER WEBSITE.

#### Additional Plugins Requirements.
Some features of Cat's need additional plugins to work, you can find them here:
